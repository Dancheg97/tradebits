Our goal is to rework the approach to create cryptocurrency means. That is no longer a piece of software, but an interface and agreement between multiple users.

Our project is based on those ideas:
- open
- fast
- free
- secure

## Open

Project is open, in a variaty of different ways...

Source code is open, community is always welcome for frontend/backend side improvements.
You can access the token network within:
- Android
- IOS
- WEB
- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux
- API
- python/go/dart SDK's

## Fast

Project is built using the rapid fast `gRPC` protocol, which allows users to get instant information loaded directly from the blockchain network. Also this protocol solves serialization and API versioning problems.

Go language in combination with `gRPC` makes network stable and prevents servers from overloading.

## Free

The core economical concept of a project is that user do not have to pay for any operation happening inside blockchain. This means that all of ORB transfering/trading operations are always covered with 0 fee.

Money cost more, when they are being used, and that is fundamental reason why we think that charging people using cryptocurrencies with fee is unacceptable.
ORB is built in such a way, that noone of the users will be charged for inner transactions.

## Secure

Most of cryptocurrecies are built using POS/POF mechanism to solve security problems. Some cryptocurrencies has centered node, which is breaking the concept of `secure by distribution`.

In this project we were able to combine the pros of system distribution over network with rapid fast speed, and we were first to achieve that relation.
