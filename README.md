[![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?label=codeSTACKr.com&style=for-the-badge&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodestackr.com)](https://webpage.com)

Our goal is to provide the best user expirience with cryptocurrency and blockchain systems.

Our cryptocurrency is based on those principals:
- open
- fast
- free
- secure
- smart

## Open

Project is fully open, in a variaty of different ways. 
Source code is open-source, community is always welcome for frontend/backend side improvements.
You can access the token network within:
- Android
- IOS
- WEB
- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux
- API
- python/go/dart SDK's

## Fast

Project is built using the rapid fast gRPC protocol, which allows users to get instant information loaded directly from the blockchain network. Also this protocol solves serialization and API versioning problems.

Go language in combination with gRPC makes network stable and prevents servers from overloading.

## Free

The core economical concept of a project is that user do not have to pay for any operation happening inside blockchain. This means that all of ORB transfering/trading operations are always covered with 0 fee.

Money cost more, when they are being used, and that is fundamental reason why we think that charging people using cryptocurrencies with fee is unacceptable.
ORB is built in such a way, that noone of the users will be charged for inner transactions.

## Secure

Most of cryptocurrecies are built using POS/POF mechanism to solve security problems. Some cryptocurrencies has centered node, which is breaking the concept of `secure by distribution`.

In this project we were able to combine the pros of system distribution over network with rapid fast speed, and we were first to achieve that relation.

## Smart

The biggest problem of most cryptocurrecnies is versioning. It is really challenging when it comes to providing good verioning system in distributed system. This system is connected to GIT aswell, and has voting system, which allows modifications across multiple users to occure.
